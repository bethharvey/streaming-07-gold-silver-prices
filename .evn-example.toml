# Instructions
# ==========================================
# 1. Copy this file to .env.toml.
#
# 2. Edit .env.toml to hold your 
#    email and app paswords.
#
# ==========================================
# Explanation
# ==========================================
# We add .env.toml to our .gitignore,
# so secrets stay safe on our machine
# and not pushed into a public GitHub repo.
#
# Leave an example file like this for reference.
#
# Secret variables are listed below.
# Keep the names exactly as they are.
# Change only the values.
#
# ==========================================
# Example Usage
# ==========================================
#
# In emailer.py,
# we use the Python standard library to send an email.
#
# We just need an outgoing email service. 
#
# We can send it using a Gmail account if we provide:
#
# - 1. our gmail address
# - 2. an outgoing email password 
#
#      This is generated by using 2-factor 
#      authentication, and creating an app password
#      
#      App password instructions: https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?hl=en
#
# ==========================================
# Requirements
# ==========================================
# 
# To read TOML files, you'll need Python 3.11+.
